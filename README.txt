===================================================
Apache PDFBox <http://incubator.apache.org/pdfbox/>
===================================================

PDFBox is an open source Java library for working with PDF documents.

Disclaimer
==========

Apache PDFBox is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates
that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have
stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While
incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
endorsed by the ASF.

See http://incubator.apache.org/projects/pdfbox.html for the current
incubation status of the Apache PDFBox project.

The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and
Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity Control
Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security software using
or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms.  The form
and manner of this Apache Software Foundation distribution makes it eligible
for export under the License Exception ENC Technology Software Unrestricted
(TSU) exception (see the BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section
740.13) for both object code and source code.

The following provides more details on the included cryptographic software:

    Apache PDFBox uses the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) and the
    Bouncy Castle libraries for handling encryption in PDF documents.
