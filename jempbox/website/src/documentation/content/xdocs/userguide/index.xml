		<title>How to commit changes</title>
		<p>Before committing a patch to Jempbox please make sure that if you build 
		the project using the build.xml ant-script there are no compilation problems 
		using a JDK 1.4 target and passing the checkstyle- and junit-tests. Additionally 
		please add a action-item to the current release in the status.xml (in the folder website)
		that characterises the changes that you made.</p>
