        This distribution includes cryptographic software. The country in
        which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import,
        possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption
        software. BEFORE using any encryption software, please check your
        country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the import,
        possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see
        if this is permitted.  See

        The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and
        Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity
        Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information
        security software using or performing cryptographic functions with
        asymmetric algorithms.  The form and manner of this Apache Software
        Foundation distribution makes it eligible for export under the
        License Exception ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU)
        exception (see the BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section
        740.13) for both object code and source code.
